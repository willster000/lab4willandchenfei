Time efficiency analysis for the algorithm:

1. Sort the items: 
Time = O(nlogn) 
Where n is the number of items.

2. Make a reverse sorted list called `availableItems` based on the sorted list: 
Time = O(n)

3. Main packing loop:
For each bin, the algorithm looks for the largest number less than or equal to the remaining space in the bin. 
In the worst case, this could be O(n) for each bin. Since you have 3 bins, this would be:
Time = 3 * O(n) = O(n) 

Combining these steps, the overall time complexity is:
O(nlogn) + O(n) + O(n) = O(nlogn)
